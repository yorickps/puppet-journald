## Overview

systemd-journald is a system service that collects and stores logging data.
It creates and maintains structured, indexed journals based on logging information
that is received from a variety of sources:

* Kernel log messages, via kmsg
* Simple system log messages, via the libc syslog(3) call
* Structured system log messages via the native Journal API, see sd_journal_print(4)
* Standard output and standard error of system services
* Audit records, via the audit subsystem

## Setup
